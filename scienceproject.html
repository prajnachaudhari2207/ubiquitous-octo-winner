<p><h1>India's satellite technology projects, such as GSAT and NavIC, have contributed to the country's telecommunications, navigation, and other services: </h1><p>
<h2><p><u>GSAT1</h2></p></u>
<h2><p><The GSAT series of communication and high throughput satellites support services like television, telecommunications, and radio networking. Some GSAT satellites include:</h2></p>
<h2><p>GSAT-8: A communication and navigation satellite inducted into the INSAT system in 2011</h2></p>
<h2><p>GSAT-10: A satellite for communication services like tele-education and telemedicine in 2011</h2></p>
<h2><p>GSAT-19: The first in the GSAT series to be launched by GSLV Mk-III in 2017</h2></p>
<h2><p>GSAT-11: India's heaviest satellite, launched in 2018, which provides high data rate connectivity to the Indian mainland and islands</h2></p>
